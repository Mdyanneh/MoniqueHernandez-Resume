        <p class="lead mb-4">Becoming a well rounded individual is something I have always aimed towards. In order to be well rounded, I have decided to become a part of many jobs, organizations, and internships. Each activity I have chose to be a part of has taught me something new skills that I am able to apply in everyday life and to other projects I am apart of. As I learn more about different careers and aspects of society, I am beginning to become more familiar to what exactly I would like to have as my career. I am also discovering new postions withing different careers that I would have never known about, had I not participated in different things even if they may have been out of my comfort zone.<br><br>

        I was fortunate enough to be a part of an internship with the city of Lake Elsinore where I worked on an advocacy project alongside the city government officials. This internship allowed me to really grasp the work that happens behind the scenes when trying to enusre a city is at its full potential. Shortly after my term in the internship program, I decided to work at Panda Express. Working at a fast food location showed me how to talk to people and be respectful especially under pressure.This job was also an introduction of handling money. I have also worked at the store Guess which also taught me about handling money as well as marketing. Working retail gave me the opportunity to learn how to make sales and really engage with buyers. My current job is a dental assistant which is the first job I have had that is apart of the medical field. In this job I have learned about the many components of running a successful buisness which involves recruiting clients,billing,organization,sanitation,and much more.I have also been able to shadow in many different dental procedures and really grasp the use of each tool.<br><br>

        Alongside interships and jobs, I have also volunteered for many organizations including Unicef, Make-a-Wish,Rotary,The Boys and Girls Club, different childrens sports teams,schools, blood drives, and retirement homes.I really find joy in helping others in any way I can, whether it's cleaning, teaching,filing,coordinating,organzing, or anything else.I believe knowledge is very powerful wich is why not only do I learn from hands-on experiences,but also by attending college. I am currently enrolled in the University of California, Riverside and am working towards a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. In order to obtain my degree, I am taking a variety of classes all in different categories. I am eager to continue learning and becoming part of different things that bring positive impacts to society.
